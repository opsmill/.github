At [OpsMill](https://opsmill.com) we believe that a strong data management platform is critical to unleash the full power of infrastructure automation. We aim to make infrastructure more agile, robust, and well-documented, allowing in-house engineering teams to focus on their craft and automation without worrying about the maintenance and upkeep of the automation infrastructure.

## Infrahub - Our first product from OpsMill

Our unique approach to infrastructure automation combines the best features of version control and a network source of truth into a schema-driven database that is easily extensible and supports all the concepts of version control.
