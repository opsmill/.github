# Reinventing infrastructure data management: The OpsMill story

[OpsMill](https://opsmill.com) was born from hard-earned experience.
 
Co-founders Damien Garros and Raphael Maunier spent years in the trenches of large-scale infrastructure, facing the same frustrations that still hold teams back today: fragile automation stacks, brittle scripts that don’t scale, disconnected tooling, and scattered data.

Again and again, they saw promising automation efforts stall. Not because of bad ideas but because the underlying data was unreliable, unstructured, or simply too hard to work with. 

Every project started with the same questions: Where’s the real data? How stale is it? Who owns it? Can I trust it enough to automate?

## Infrahub: The platform we wished we had

Damien and Raphael founded OpsMill, and assembled a team of seasoned infrastructure engineers who’d also experienced the data struggle first-hand. Together, they scoped and built the system they'd always wanted: a customizable, testable, and versioned foundation for infrastructure automation. 

Launched in late 2024, Infrahub is a graph-based data management platform with built-in version control, CI workflows, peer review, and API access. It's purpose-built to power reliable infrastructure automation at scale.
